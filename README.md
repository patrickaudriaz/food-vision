# Machine Learning Model Deployment

###  **[APP LINK](https://patrick-dl-playground-319315.uc.r.appspot.com/)** 

This project is available as a [Streamlit](http://streamlit.io/)-powered web application for classifying images of food (deployed as a Docker container on Google Cloud Platform).

* **Data:** Slices of [Food101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101).
* **Model(s):** [EfficientNetB0](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetB0) backbone's with different output layers (10 classes).
